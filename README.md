1) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that devlops individualized financial plans for saving, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They desire to modernize their operations and, as crucial part of the success of its custom sofware, want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Currently, they have a RESTful web application programming interface and is seeking our expertise in taking steps to protecting the organization from exernal threats. 

2) What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I did well at identifying the current vulnerabilites in the code base through static testing. Secure coding is imporant to prevent data theft, which is important to the client's patrons. 

3) What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The dependency check tools were very helpful for detecting vulnerabilities instead of manually checking each dependency.

4)How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

My approach to the need to increase layers of security was to find the best encryption algorithm cipher that would not take up too many resources. I would use penetration testing in the future to better assess vulnerability of the code and make more use of the CVE databse to find solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities. 

5) How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, I ran the code to see if was functional. Afterwards, I did another dependency check to see if the change from refactoring the code introduced new vulnerabilites.

6) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks? 

Running a dependcy check using Maven helped with outlining the dependencies in the code, which helped me learn what the vulnerabilites that were needed to address. The list of encryption algorithm ciphers given was also helpful.

7) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

From this particular assignment, I outlined the recommended encryption algorithm cipher to use and provided a brief, high-level overview of it.
